This directory contains the scripts necessary to run the four PacBio
AAV datasets referenced in the paper,

The Tiling Algorithm -- A general method for structural characterization
of accurate long DNA sequence reads: application to AAV genome sequences

submitted to PlosONE.

In order to rerun these scripts, you will need to download the
sequence files from
https://downloads.pacbcloud.com/public/dataset/AAV/ and place them
into the directory, data, under this directory. The file, "ls-lR.txt",
contains the output for "ls -laR" for the data files. The file,
"files.md5", contains the output from md5sum on all the data files.
The README.txt file in "data" was the original from Pacific Biosciences.

The reference for the mixed sample (2022-ssAAV-scAAV-mix) was
generated manually by combining the ITR sequence and the payload and
backbones from pAV-CMV-GFP_split.fasta and scAAV_CBA_eGFP_split.fasta.

The other references were taken from the files provided by PacBio.
