This directory is a stub for the data files used to run the example from the tiling algorithm paper. At the time of writing, a request has been made to Pacbio to archive these data files in Zenodo. For now, the files herein will help in confirming that the data matches what was used in the paper.

The README.txt file is a copy of the README.txt from PacBio's web site,  https://downloads.pacbcloud.com/public/dataset/AAV/, which contains all the AAV sequences used in this example.

The file, ls-lR.txt, contains the listing of the files used in running the examples, and the file, files.md5, contains the MD5 checksum to check for any differences from what was used for the tiling algorithm paper.
