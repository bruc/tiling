How to run the tiling algorithm.

Running the tiling algorithm requires installing Bio::Frescobi and its
prerequisites. Bio::Frescobi is available on Github
(https://github.com/bruc/Bio-Frescobi) and will eventually be added to
CPAN. You will also need to define the environment variable,
BUILD_PREFIX, which is where the prerequisites for Bio::Frescobi are
found.

It's also important to know how to read Bash scripts -- the scripts
that are included with this Git repository are very instructive if you
can understand them.

The best way to proceed is to start with the example scripts and
specifically, example/scripts/run_tiling_2021-scAAV-CBA-eGFP.sh. This
example shows how to process eight samples.

There are several variables that control the execution of the
script. Here's the list:

d_path    The location of the CCS reads to be analyzed.
fa_s	  The list of reference sequences that are expected to be found in the samples being sequenced.
names	  The corresponding names for the reference sequences. These names must be in the same order
	  and number as the fa_s variable.
barcodes  A colon separated list of barcodes used in the sequencing run.
templates The corresponding list of references (by name) for each barcode, colon separated.
run	  The database name.
tiling_d  Where the tiling results are supposed to go.
scriptdir The folder containing the tile.pl script.

------------------------------------------------

The script, example/scripts/convert_dna.sh, is used to split the
sequence of a plasmid used to make an AAV into three parts, the ITR,
the payload, and the backbone. It depends upon a Perl script,
reformat_viral_plasmid.pl, that looks for the ITR sequence and then
performs the division.

It is important for the execution of the tiling algorithm that the
reference not contain repeated sequences. If they are found, they need
to be split from the unique sequences. Examples are in
example/references in files whose name ends in "_split.fasta".
